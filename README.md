## ✔ WorkFlow 

#### 👉🏻 Commits Format 📜
- Always create the branch from develop 
- The branch name format is: `feature/{jiraTicket#}`.
- The pull request title format is: `{jiraTicket#}: {jiraTitle}`. 
- The commits format is: `{jiraTicket#}: {commitDescription}`, Small commits are a nice to have.
- The pull request has to contain only the changes related to the scope defined in the ticket.
- Pull request should always be from your current branch to develop.

#### 👉🏻 Branches Format 📜
In the current repository you will see three diferent branches
- `main` -> this branch is only for productive versions, it has official release history.
- `develop` -> this branch serves as an integration branch for features. All features must start from this branch and after it's finished it gets merged back into develop.
For understanding more about git and how to work with different branches, I recommend to read about Gitflow workflow. [Here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) you have a little explanation that can serve as introduction.

#### 👉🏻 Scrum 🤝
- Sprints last one week.
- Two mandatory meetings with team leader per sprint.
- The maximum duration of the daily meeting is 15 min.
- Tasks without an epic are not allowed.
- Epics have to be backed by user stories.
- Tasks have to be assigned according to estimate.
